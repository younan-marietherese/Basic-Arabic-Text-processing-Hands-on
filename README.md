# Basic Arabic Text Processing: Hands-on NLP

This project explores **Basic Arabic Text Processing** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The primary objective is to preprocess Arabic text by removing unnecessary characters, tokenizing the text, and performing lemmatization using Arabic NLP tools.

---

## Project Overview
In this project, we focus on processing a small dataset of Arabic tweets or Facebook posts. The goal is to clean the text, tokenize it, and lemmatize it using Arabic NLP tools such as **Farasa** or **Madamira**. After processing, the original text is compared with the lemmatized version, and observations are made regarding the changes in the text.

This project helps to practice basic Arabic NLP tasks, such as text preprocessing, tokenization, and lemmatization.

## Objectives
- Create a dataset of 10 Arabic tweets or Facebook posts.
- Preprocess the text by removing punctuation, emojis, and other unwanted sequences.
- Tokenize the Arabic text using whitespace as a delimiter.
- Apply lemmatization using Arabic NLP tools like Farasa or Madamira.
- Compare the original text with the lemmatized version and describe the differences.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For developing the NLP pipeline.
- **Pandas**: For managing the dataset.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: For text cleaning and removing unwanted characters.
- **Farasa/Madamira**: Arabic lemmatization tools.
- **Google Colab**: Optional platform for running the notebook.

## Dataset
A mini dataset of 10 Arabic tweets or Facebook posts is created and processed. The dataset contains:
- **Original Text**: The raw Arabic text as it appears in the post.
- **Tokenized Text**: The text tokenized by splitting on whitespace.
- **Lemmatized Text**: The text transformed into its root form using an Arabic lemmatizer.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the Arabic text into a DataFrame.
   - Use regular expressions to remove punctuation, emojis, and other unwanted sequences from the text.

2. **Tokenization**:
   - Split the Arabic text into individual tokens using whitespace as the delimiter.

3. **Lemmatization**:
   - Apply lemmatization using Arabic tools like **Farasa** or **Madamira** to transform the words into their root forms.

4. **Comparison and Analysis**:
   - Compare the original text with the lemmatized version.
   - Write observations about how the text has changed during the lemmatization process and justify why these changes occurred.
